<h1>Parkinson’s Disease Detection using Machine Learning </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Problem Statement:
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement, speech, and quality of life. Early diagnosis is challenging because initial symptoms are subtle and often overlooked. Delayed detection can limit treatment effectiveness, reduce quality of life, and increase healthcare costs. There is a pressing need for a reliable, non-invasive, and data-driven method to detect the disease at its earliest stages, enabling timely intervention and better patient outcomes.


Project Overview:
This project focuses on building a machine learning system to predict whether a patient is likely to have Parkinson’s disease based on biomedical voice measurements. Early detection of Parkinson’s disease is critical, as timely intervention can significantly improve a patient’s quality of life and slow disease progression.
The project was inspired by a medical research initiative aimed at leveraging technology to support early and accurate diagnosis, enabling medical professionals to prioritize high-risk patients for further clinical evaluation.


Model Approach:
- </b>The solution uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier — a powerful supervised learning algorithm known for its effectiveness in binary classification tasks.</b>
- </b>Data Source: Parkinson’s disease dataset containing multiple biomedical voice measurements</b>
- </b>Model Selection: Chose SVM due to its ability to handle high-dimensional data and create optimal decision boundaries</b>
- </b>Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to assess performance</b>

Build and Test Process: </b>
- </b>Data Preprocessing – Cleaned dataset, handled missing values, and scaled features.</b>
- </b>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Analyzed patterns and feature correlations to understand the data</b>
- </b>Model Training – Trained the SVM model with labeled data, tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance</b>
- </b>Model Testing – Evaluated the model on unseen test data to measure predictive performance</b>
- </b>Validation – Used cross-validation to ensure model generalization and avoid overfitting</b>
<h2>Skills </h2>

- </b>Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)</b>
- </b>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</b>
- </b>Machine Learning (SVM Classification)</b>
- </b>Feature engineering</b>
- </b>Model Evaluation & Performance Tuning</b>


<h2>Outcomes </h2>

- </b>Developed a machine learning model capable of predicting Parkinson’s disease with high accuracy. Provided a framework for early detection that can assist medical professionals in prioritizing patient care.
Showcased the potential of ML in healthcare diagnostics and disease prevention.
