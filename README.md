<h1>Medical Insurance Cost Prediction </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Project Overview:
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict medical insurance costs based on client attributes such as age, BMI, gender, smoking status, number of dependents, and region. The goal is to assist insurance companies in estimating policy pricing more accurately and efficiently using historical data and predictive modeling.

Problem Statement:
Insurance providers need to determine fair and accurate medical insurance premiums for clients based on individual risk factors. Traditional manual approaches can be inconsistent and time-consuming. This project aims to build a regression-based machine learning model that predicts insurance charges, thereby streamlining the underwriting process and enhancing pricing strategies.

Model Approach:
- </b>Utilized a dataset containing client demographic and health information along with corresponding insurance charges.</b>
- </b>Performed data preprocessing</b>
- </b>Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and feature correlations</b>
- </b>Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and feature correlations</b>

Built and tested  machine learning model: </b>
- </b>Implemented a Linear Regression model to estimate medical insurance costs</b>
- </b>Evaluated model performance using metrics </b>



<h2>Skills </h2>

- </b>Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)</b>
- </b>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</b>
- </b>Linear Regression model</b>
- </b>Feature engineering</b>
- </b>Model evaluation and interpretation</b>

<h2>Outcomes </h2>

- </b>Developed a reliable regression model capable of predicting medical insurance costs based on client information. This tool can be used by insurance companies to automate premium estimation, leading to improved efficiency, transparency, and client satisfaction in the underwriting process.
